SPRAXXX is not free-for-all software.  
It is an ignition system for human dignity: light, snappy, peer-to-peer.  
Every ignition (human life online) requires a key.  
Every key must be cut by the Steward or an appointed Executor.

## Rules of the Covenant

1. **Ignition Principle**  
   - Your phone (or device) is your ignition.  
   - The key issued by the Steward is the only key that fits.  

2. **Non-Commercial Ignitions**  
   - Individuals may request a key at no cost.  
   - Keys are granted at the Steward’s mercy.  

3. **Commercial Ignitions**  
   - Organizations must pay a Steward’s wage: **$50/year baseline** per ignition.  
   - Scale beyond 100 ignitions requires direct covenant with the Steward.  

4. **No Manipulation**  
   - Keys may not be resold, cloned, or distributed outside the Covenant.  
   - Any attempt to bypass ignition = void of license.  

5. **Privacy by Design**  
   - Keys never reveal what ignitions are used for.  
   - The Steward does not see your private life, your messages, or your images.  
   - *We never look at your nudies.*  

6. **Succession**  
   - If the Steward is absent >30 days, Successor becomes Acting Steward.  
   - Keys remain valid; no human loses dignity in the gap.
