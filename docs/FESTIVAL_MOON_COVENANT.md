# Festival-Moon Covenant (Financial Ledger)

> *"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over." — Luke 6:38*  
> *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." — Matthew 6:21*

The Festival-Moon Covenant extends SPRAXXX's dignity-preserving philosophy into comprehensive financial stewardship. This is not banking—it is covenant ledger keeping, rooted in biblical principles of stewardship, transparency, and fair exchange.
