# Origin Story — From Debate to Covenant

Every system has an origin, and SPRAXXX is no different.  
This is Jacques’ story: a lived arc of resistance, survival, and transformation.

## Grade 11 — The Hustle

- Jacques sold marijuana in high school.  
- Not out of greed, but survival: *“Man’s gotta chop, man’s gotta make some cash. He’s not gonna be on the welfare.”*  
- He was making a living, and everybody knew it. The teacher knew. The students knew. The principal hunted him like the law itself.

---

## Protection and Grace

- One day, the principal was ready to bust Jacques — to hand him over, criminalize him, brand him.  
- But a teacher stepped in.  
- Instead of betrayal, Jacques found protection. Someone saw the human being, not just the “offense.”  
- That teacher’s grace redirected him.

## Debate Club — The Turning Point

- Jacques joined the debate club.  
- Topic: **legalization of marijuana.**  
- He argued from lived truth, not abstract theory.  
- And he won.  
- This was years before Canada legalized cannabis, but the truth was already on his lips: prohibition was unjust, survival wasn’t a crime, and the system needed change.

## History Catches Up

- Canada legalized cannabis.  
- What Jacques fought for as a teen, what he debated and defended, became law.  
- Proof that lived truth and relentless argument can bend systems.  
- Proof that what is profiled today can be vindicated tomorrow.

## From Cannabis to Communication

- The battles didn’t end in high school.  
- Profiling, exploitation, unjust systems — they follow everywhere: in courts, in cops, in code.  
- Jacques took the same fire into technology.  
- Now, with **SPRAXXX**, the fight is for dignity in digital communication:
  - No profiling by code.  
  - No poison in your inbox.  
  - No endless hoarding of your words.  
  - No links without consent.  
  - Every human being is sacred.

## The Continuum

- Cannabis legalization was the **first proving ground**: resistance, debate, victory.  
- SPRAXXX is the **next proving ground**: reshaping how mankind communicates, safely and with covenant.  
- Both are rooted in the same truth: humans deserve dignity, not criminalization; safety, not suspicion.
