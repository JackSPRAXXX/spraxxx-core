# SPRAXXX Tax Policy

**Transparent. Automatic. Immutable.**

## 1. Purpose

SPRAXXX ensures that all earnings, expenses, and tax liabilities are automatically calculated, recorded, and reserved in compliance with Canadian law. This removes ambiguity, protects our members, and guarantees fairness across all categories of users.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Transparency**: All tax calculations are visible to the user in real-time.
- **Fairness**: No hidden deductions, no manipulation. What you earn, you see.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with the Income Tax Act (Canada), CRA guidelines, and provincial rules (Ontario baseline).
- **Autonomy**: Users control their funds; SPRAXXX only facilitates calculation and reserve tagging.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all SPRAXXX users, including but not limited to:

- Sole proprietors
- Registered corporations
- Ministers and service providers
- Independent workers (security, healthcare, creative, community, etc.)

## 4. Tax Categories Tracked

1. **Income Tax (Federal + Provincial)**
   - Calculated on profit (revenue – allowable expenses).
   - Progressive brackets updated annually based on CRA schedules.
2. **HST/GST (Goods & Services Tax, Harmonized Sales Tax)**
   - Auto-applied if user’s revenues exceed CRA registration threshold ($30,000 CAD annually, or voluntarily earlier).
   - Automatically separated from gross income and reserved.
3. **Payroll Deductions (if hiring staff)**
   - EI (Employment Insurance), CPP (Canada Pension Plan), Income Tax withheld.
   - Employer + employee shares calculated, reserved, and reported.
4. **Deductible Expenses**
   - All business-related expenses (rent, tools, utilities, software, travel, etc.) tracked.
   - Automatically offsets taxable profit.

## 5. Reserve Mechanism

- Every transaction is tagged in real-time.
- A Canada Revenue Wallet (CRA Reserve) is maintained per user.
- At the close of each reporting cycle (monthly, quarterly, annually), funds for tax obligations are already set aside.

## 6. Reporting & Filing

- Users receive auto-generated reports (CRA-ready T2125, T2, GST/HST returns).
- AI-assisted filing via direct integration or export.
- Audit trail preserved immutably in the ledger.

## 7. User Responsibilities

- Keep personal vs. business expenses separated.
- Verify categories suggested by AI (overrides permitted).
- Submit filings on time (SPRAXXX provides reminders + automation).

## 8. SPRAXXX Responsibilities

- Keep tax logic updated annually based on CRA schedules.
- Maintain cryptographic integrity of all tax records.
- Provide clear reporting dashboards for users.
- Never withhold or transfer funds without explicit user authorization.

## 9. Compliance & Protection

- SPRAXXX aligns with:
  - Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1)
  - Excise Tax Act (GST/HST)
  - Employment Insurance Act
  - Canada Pension Plan Act
- By maintaining transparent, immutable records, SPRAXXX users are shielded from disputes and empowered during audits.

## 10. Philosophy

SPRAXXX transforms taxation from a source of fear into a mathematical truth.

- No more guesswork.
- No more government surprises.
- Taxes are paid as you go, set aside in real-time, leaving users free to focus on building, creating, protecting, and living.
