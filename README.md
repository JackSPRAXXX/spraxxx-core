# SPRAXXX Core

> “The worker is worthy of his wages.” – Luke 10:7  

SPRAXXX is not just a product. It is a covenantal promise.  
A shield against digital garbage. A beacon of sovereignty.  
A community rooted in stewardship, truth, and companionship.  

## What lives here

- **WHITEPAPER.md** – the full explanation of the sovereignty stack.  
- **spraxxx-onboard.sh** – the script that provisions new humans (WireGuard + SSH).  
- **app.py** – the tiny API that connects the Companion, the website, and the server.  
- **LICENSE** – the covenant that protects this work.  

## Ethos

We do not sell garbage. We do not rent identity.  
Every human holds their own key.  
Every connection is rooted in dignity.  
Every act of stewardship is worth its wages.
