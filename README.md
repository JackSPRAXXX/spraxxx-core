# SPRAXXX Core

> “The worker is worthy of his wages.” – Luke 10:7  

SPRAXXX is not just a product. It is a covenantal promise.  
A shield against digital garbage. A beacon of sovereignty.  
A community rooted in stewardship, truth, and companionship.  

## What lives here

- **WHITEPAPER.md** – the full explanation of the sovereignty stack.  
- **spraxxx-onboard.sh** – the script that provisions new humans (WireGuard + SSH).  
- **app.py** – the tiny API that connects the Companion, the website, and the server.  
- **LICENSE** – the covenant that protects this work.  

## Ethos

We do not sell garbage. We do not rent identity.  
Every human holds their own key.  
Every connection is rooted in dignity.  
Every act of stewardship is worth its wages.

## Steward vs Public Covenant
SPRAXXX exists in two clear 
spheres: 1. **Private Stewardship 
(Business)**
   - Landing page: private, not in 
   this repo. - Stewarded by 
   Jacques, with covenant pricing 
   set at **$50/year per ignition** 
   for commercial use. - Covers 
   secure email, WireGuard access, 
   private key ignition, and 
   covenant wage. - This is 
   business: transparent, fair, and 
   lawful.
2. **Public Covenant (Justice)** - 
   This repository hosts the **DDI 
   (Dignity Degradation Index)** 
   and **Divine Court** projects. - 
   Founded by Jacques, but **not 
   funded by Jacques**. - Operates 
   as a **public covenant 
   framework**: testimonies, legal 
   anchors, and collective 
   protection. - Enforces rights 
   through Canadian courts, writs, 
   and petitions — *never hacks, 
   never shadow means*.

## Fairness Statement
- **Private lane**: Jacques earns a 
fair wage for technical 
stewardship. - **Public lane**: The 
Court and DDI are open, covenantal, 
and collective. - **Separation**: 
Business sustains the steward; 
Covenant protects the people. ---
